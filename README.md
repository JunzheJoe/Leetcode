# 🏆 My LeetCode Solutions

I post my daily LeetCode practices and summaries in this repository. Sometimes, I might be lazy after finishing a question and not write a summary here. 

## 📌 Repository Structure
Each problem in this repository contains:
- `solution.py` – My Python solution for the problem.
- `README.md` – A detailed explanation following a structured template.

## 🎯 Special Thanks
A big **thank you** to **Nollie (Huiyu) Chen** for providing the summary template that helps keep my explanations organized! 🙌

## 😅 Special Note
Not every question contains a README.md since solutions might be very straightforward.
